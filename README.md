# JavaScript Drill - Advanced Exercises (With Methods)
```

This branch extends the exercises by using reusable functions and modularized code, making the solutions more structured and maintainable.

```


## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone -b withmethods https://github.com/Sivakumar1003/js-drill-02.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```
    cd js-drill-02
    ```
3. **Run the test files using Node.js**:
    ```
    node Test/test1.js
    ```
    Replace `test1.js` with any other test file (`test2.js`, `test3.js`, etc.).

## Features
* Closures & Lexical Scoping (`problem1.js`)
* Asynchronous Programming with Promises (`problem2.js`)
* Higher-Order Functions (`problem3.js`)
* Module Pattern Implementation (`problem4.js`)
* Prototypal Inheritance (`problem5.js`)
* ES6 Classes & Inheritance (`problem6.js`)
* Generators & Iterators (`problem7.js`)
* Async/Await for Asynchronous Code (`problem8.js`)

## Enhancements in this Branch
* ✅ **Reusability**: Common logic is moved to utils.js for reuse across exercises.
* ✅ **Modular Code Structure**: Code is structured with separate helper functions.
* ✅ **Maintainability**: Easier to update and debug solutions.
* ✅ **Test Folder**: Every problem is tested using test files inside Test/.
